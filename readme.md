In his project i've buit an interactive weather app which fetches data from an external API
I've also added a dark mode theme to make it appealing
usser can be able to get weather info of any city by displaying the correct city name
ie:the temperature,humidity,description and weather emoji
if the user enters a wrong/invalid city name it displays a message  "could not fetch data"
